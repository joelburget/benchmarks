<h2>About</h2>

<h3>The Organization</h3>
<p>This application was developed by The Ohio State University <a href="http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/rsrg/">Reusable Software Research Group.</a></p>

<p>Our research is primarily directed at modular verification of software.</p>

<p>One of our goals is to design benchmarks with the intent on documenting progress towards verified compilation. A list of the original 9 benchmarks can be seen in our paper: <a href="http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/rsrg/documents/2008/08WSHABBHKF.pdf">Proceedings of VSTTE 2008 (Verified Software: Theories, Tools, and Experiments)</a></p>

<h3>The Application</h3>
<p>The Benchmarks application was built to help researchers across the globe connect and collaborate on problems, and their potential solutions, on the web.</p>

<h3>What next?</h3>
<p>Now that you know a bit about the underpinnings of our organization and our application, feel free to <a href="/getting-started/">join and get started now.</a></p>
