<h1>Sanitizing</h1>

<h3>What We Do</h3>
<p>Before we store any text on our server, we sanitize it to prevent attacks. We remove any Javascript or HTML that could potentially be used for an XSS attack.</p>

<h3>How?</h3>
<p>We use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/">html5lib</a> to sanitize the input. We prefer using a well tested library to writing our own. You can see all the tags that html5lib will allow <a href="http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/source/browse/python/html5lib/sanitizer.py">at their repository.</a> Note that we do not allow mathml or svg.</p>
