<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<h3>Membership</h3>
<h4>Why Join?</h4>
<p>Anyone can view posts and comments but members enjoy these benefits:</p>
<ul class="icons">
  <li id="propose-link">Propose new benchmarks or solutions on this site.</li>
  <li id="comment-link">Comment on other posts.</li>
  <li id="collab-link">Collaborate with other researchers interested in software verification in a centralized location.</li>
  <li id="contact-link">Allow other researchers to contact you easily (please note: we will share only the information you allow).</li>
</ul>

<h4>How to Join</h4>
<p>If you don't have an account yet, please <a href="/join/">create</a> one now. We will respond, hopefully, within a day or two, providing you with a link in your email inbox to let you create your account.</p>

<h3>Your First Login</h3>
<h4>Fill out your Profile</h4>
<p>After you sign in for the first time, open your {% if user.is_authenticated %}<a href="{{ user.get_absolute_url }}">profile</a>{% else %}profile (see the top right corner of the page, where it says "Hello &lt;name&gt;!"){% endif %}. From there, click "Edit Profile" and fill out your personal information, if you desire to do so. Of course, we highly recommend not skipping this step! It will allow other researchers to easily get in touch with you!</p>

<h3>Posting Content</h3>
<h4>Post Types</h4>
<p>Each post can be classified as a Problem, a proposed Solution to a problem, or Other (used for interesting papers, for example). To create a new Problem, see the next section on <a href="#newpost">on adding new problems</a>. To propose a new Solution to a problem, scroll to the "Actions" section of a problem and click "Add a solution to this problem."</p>

<h4 id="newpost">Adding New Problems</h4>
<p>Click on <a href="/posts/new">New Problem</a> in the right-hand toolbar. This will take you to an editor where you can create benchmark problems for others to submit solutions to.</p>

<h4>Formatting Content</h4>
<p>Most HTML tags, such as &lt;p&gt;, <b>&lt;b&gt;</b>, <i>&lt;i&gt;</i>, and <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> are allowed. CSS such as <span style="font-family:monospace; font-size: 1.25em;">style="font-weight:bold;"</span> is also allowed, but not recommended. We have default stylings for all page elements. Javascript is not allowed for security reasons. Additionally, LaTeX formatting can be achieved by surrounding single line formulas in double-dollar signs (for example, <code>$$x^2$$</code>).</p> 

<h4>Uploading Attachments to Posts</h4>
<p>Files can be included through HTML hyperlinks, or by using the file upload button below the text field.  You may upload as many files and filetypes as you like.  Zipped folders and tarballs (*.zip, *.tar.gz, *.tar.bz2, or similar) will automatically be decompressed. Users will be offered the choice of looking in a tree browser to preview files one at a time, or downloading the entire archive.</p> 

<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>Commenting is included for every post. Comments are numbered to aid discussion. The same HTML, CSS, and LaTeX that can be used in posts can be used in comments.</p>
