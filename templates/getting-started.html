<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<h3>Membership</h3>
<p>Anyone can view posts and comments but members enjoy these benefits:</p>
<ul class="bullets">
  <li>Propose new benchmarks or solutions on this site.</li>
  <li>Comment on other posts.</li>
  <li>Collaborate with other researchers interested in software verification in a centralized location.</li>
  <li>Allow other researchers to contact you more easily (we will share only the information you allow).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Get a username</h3>
<p>The rest of this guide assumes you have a username. If you don't have one yet please fill out the form under "Request an account" in the right sidebar. We will respond within a day or two with your new username and password.</p>

<h3>Set your information</h3>
<p>After you sign in for the first time, click on the link to your profile in the top right (it should either be your name, or your username). You can add a short bio about yourself, update your email, and set your email to be shown to other users, if desired. We will never show your email to visitors who aren't signed in</p>

<h3>Posts</h3>

<h4>Adding New Posts</h4>
<p>Once your account is set up the next step is to post something. Click on <a href="posts/new">New Post</a> in the right-hand toolbar. This will take you to an editor where you can input posts, formatted with basic HTML.

<h4>Formatting Posts</h4>
<p>Most html tags, such as &lt;p&gt;, <b>&lt;b&gt;</b>, <i>&lt;i&gt;</i>, and <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> are allowed. CSS (in the form of a style attribute, such as style="font-weight:bold;") is also allowed but not recommended, and Javascript is of course not allowed. In addition, LaTeX formtting can be achieved by surrounding single line formulas in two pairs of dollar signs (example, $$x^2$$ will be displayed as {{ "$$x^2$$"|tex_to_images }}). For more information on how we sanitize posts, see our <a href="/sanitizing/">sanitizing information page</a>, although everything will usually just work as you would expect it to.</p> 

<h4>Uploading Attachments to Posts</h4>
<p>Files can be included through HTML hyperlinks, or by using the file upload button below the text field.  You may upload as many files and filetypes as you like.  Zipped folders and tarballs (*.zip, *.tar.gz, *.tar.bz2, or similar) will automatically be decompressed. Users will be offered the choice of looking in a tree browser to download files one at a time, or downloading the entire archive.</p> 

<h4>Linking to Other Posts</h4>
<p>Each post can be classified as a Problem, Realization, Verification, or Other. Each type of post except Problem can be linked to the post it is in response to. For instance a verification would be linked to the realization it verifies. See other posts on the site for examples.</p>

<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>Commenting is included for every post. Comments are numbered to aid discussion. The same HTML, CSS, and LaTeX that can be used in posts can be used in comments.</p>
