Simple html tags such as &lt;p&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, and &lt;code&gt; are allowed. Javascript is not. Files can be included through hyperlinks or by using the file upload button below the text field. Posts can be classified as Problem, Realization, Verification, or Other. See other posts on the site for clarification of the distinction.</p>
